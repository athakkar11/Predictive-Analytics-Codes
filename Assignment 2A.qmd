## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
library(dplyr); library(lubridate); library(readr); library(stringr); library(forcats); library(tidyr)
birthdays = read.csv('/Users/anshitathakkar/Documents/Predictive Analytics/president_birthdays.csv')
heights = read.csv('/Users/anshitathakkar/Documents/Predictive Analytics/president_heights.csv')
states = read.csv('/Users/anshitathakkar/Documents/Predictive Analytics/president_states.csv')

birthdays

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

```{r}

```{r}

library(lubridate); mdy(birthdays$birthday)
library(lubridate); ymd(birthdays$birthday)
as.Date(birthdays$birthday,format='%m / %d / %Y')
as.Date(birthdays$birthday,format='%b / %d / %Y')
```

```{r}
parse_character('Name')
as.character('Name')

birthdays
```

```{r}

  summarise(birthday)

as.Date('4/7/1776',format='%d/%m/%Y')

month(mdy('7/4/1776'),label = T)
table(month(mdy('7/4/1776'),label = T))
table(birthdays$birthday)
```

```{r}
library(lubridate); library(readr); library(dplyr)

birthdays %>%
  mutate(birthday = mdy(birthdays$birthday))

```

```{r}
birthdays %>%
  mutate(birthday = mdy(birthdays$birthday))|>
  separate(col = birthday, into = c('year', 'month', 'day', sep = '-'))
  group_by(month(birthdays,))


```

```{r}
birthdays
```

```{r}
birthdays %>%
  mutate(birthday = mdy(birthdays$birthday))%>%
  mutate(birthday = dmy(birthdays$birthday))%>%
  separate(col = location,into = c('country','continent'), sep = ',')%>%

```{r}
heights
```

Q4. In the dataset, heights, the height of Presidents contain the unit in which height is expressed. As a result of this, it is not possible to use the data in the heights column for quantitative analysis.

Run appropriate code to extract only the height in inches and save as a new variable. What is the average height?

```{r}
parse_number(heights$height)
heights
```

```{r}

parse_number('74 inches')
parse_number(heights$height)

heights_in_inches = parse_number(heights$height)
heights_in_inches

mean(heights_in_inches)
```

Q5 In the dataset, heights, create a new variable containing height in cm. Use the conversion, 1 inch = 2.54 cm.

What is the median height in cm?

```{r}
median(heights_in_inches)*2.54
```

Q6 In the dataset, heights, standardize height in inches such that mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1.

What is President Joe Biden's standardized height?

```{r}
heights$heights_scaled <- scale(heights_in_inches)
heights$heights_scaled
heights
```

Q 7

In the dataset height, bin height in inches into a categorical variable with the following four groups:

Short: height\<=66 Average: 66 \< height \<= 69 Tall: 69 \< height \<= 72 Very Tall: height \> 72 Call this variable, height_cat4. Based on this new variable, height_cat4, how many Presidents are categorized as being "Very Tall"?

```{r}
heights$height_short = ifelse(test = (heights$height_in_inches <= 66), yes = 1,no = 0)
heights$height_Average = ifelse(test = (heights$height_in_inches <=69 & heights$height_in_inches > 66), yes = 1,no = 0)
heights$height_Tall = ifelse(test = (heights$height_in_inches <=72 & heights$height_in_inches > 69), yes = 1,no = 0)
heights$height_VeryTall = ifelse(test = (heights$height_in_inches >= 72),yes = 1,no = 0)

height_cat4 <- c(heights$height_short, heights$height_Average, heights$height_Tall, heights$height_VeryTall)

height_cat4
```

```{r}
library(dplyr); library(forcats)
heights %>%
       mutate(height_cat = fct_recode(.f = height_cat4, "Average" = "Short", "Average" = "Average","Tall" = "Tall","Very Tall" = "Very Tall"))

heights
```

updated_dataset$Birth.State = str_trim(updated_dataset$Birth.State)
