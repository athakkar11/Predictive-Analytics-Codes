## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

```{r}
taxi = read.csv('/Users/anshitathakkar/Documents/Predictive Analytics/taxi.csv')
taxi
```


```{r}
taxi$pickup_day = factor(x = taxi$pickup_day,levels = c('Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun')) 
taxi$period_of_month = factor(x = taxi$period_of_month,levels = c('beginning','middle','end')) 
taxi$period_of_day = factor(x = taxi$period_of_day, levels = c('morning','afternoon', 'evening','night'))
```

Question 1

Read in the data using read.csv() and assign it to an object, taxi. Next, specify the levels for pickup_day, period_of_month, and period_of_day by running the following code.

taxi = read.csv('taxi.csv') 
taxi$pickup_day = factor(x = taxi$pickup_day,levels = c('Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun')) 
taxi$period_of_month = factor(x = taxi$period_of_month,levels = c('beginning','middle','end')) 
taxi$period_of_day = factor(x = taxi$period_of_day, levels = c('morning','afternoon', 'evening','night'))


Next, split the data, taxi, into a train and test sample such that 70% of the data is in the train sample. To ensure a similar distribution of "tip_amount" across the train and test samples, use createDataPartition from library(caret). Set groups to 200 and use a seed of 1031. What is the median tip_amount in the train sample? [Unless stated otherwise, use the train sample for conducting analysis.]

```{r}
str(taxi)

library(caret)
set.seed(1031)
split = createDataPartition(y=taxi$tip_amount,p = 0.7,list = F,groups = 200)
train = taxi[split,]
test = taxi[-split,]

median(train$tip_amount)
```


Question 2

Construct a scatter plot to examine the relationship between distance (trip_distance) and tip amount (tip_amount). Place trip_distance on the x-axis and tip_amount on the y-axis. What is the direction of the points?

```{r}
ggplot(data=train,aes(x=trip_distance,y=tip_amount))+
  geom_point()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,40))+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar())+
  theme_bw()
```

Q 3 What is the correlation between trip_distance and tip_amount? (Do you see a link between the scatter plot and the correlation measure?)
Which of the following variables has the strongest correlation with tip_amount?

Question 4

```{r}
cor(train$tolls_amount, train$tip_amount)
cor(train$trip_duration, train$tip_amount)
cor(train$fare_amount, train$tip_amount)
cor(train$trip_distance, train$tip_amount)
```
