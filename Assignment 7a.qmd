## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
games = read.csv('board_games.csv')
games
```

```{r}
str(games)

#This dataset contains information on over 10,000 board games. Our goal is to gain an understanding of the factors that makes a game popular and be able to predict its rating.

Q1
Read the data into games using read.csv(). Split games into a train and test sample such that 70% of the data is in the train sample. To ensure a similar distribution of "rating" across the train and test samples, use createDataPartition from the caret package. Set groups to 200 and use a seed of 1031. What is the mean rating in the train sample? [Unless stated otherwise, use the train sample for conducting analysis.]
```{r}
library(ISLR2)

library(caret)
set.seed(1031)
split = createDataPartition(y = games$rating, p = 0.70, list = F,groups = 200)
train = games[split,]
test = games[-split,]
```
```{r}
mean = mean(train$rating); mean

```


Q2 Which of the following variables is most strongly correlated with game "rating"? Note, question is about strength of correlation not direction.

	
min_age

max_players

age_of_game

playtime

min_players

```{r}
cor(games$rating, games$min_age)
cor(games$rating, games$max_players)
cor(games$rating, games$age_of_game)
cor(games$rating, games$playtime)
cor(games$rating, games$min_players)

```

Q3 
Which of the following is the most popular game category? Note: "Yes" in a category column indicates the game in the row was labeled as belonging to that category.
Question 3 options:

Fantasy

Wargame

Economic

CardGame

Fighting


```{r}
sum(train$CardGame == "Yes")
sum(train$Economic == "Yes")
sum(train$Fantasy == "Yes")
sum(train$Fighting == "Yes")
sum(train$Wargame == "Yes")
```
Q4 Which of the following game categories have the highest rating? Note: "Yes" in a category column indicates the game in the row was labeled as being in that category
