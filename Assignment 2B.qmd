## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed). Assignment 2B

```{r}
library(dplyr); library(readr); library(tidyr)
```

```{r}
sales = data.frame(company = c("Apple","Google","Amazon","Microsoft"),
           year_2017 = c(229234,110855,177866,96571),
           year_2018 = c(65595,136819,232887,110360),
           year_2019 = c(260174,161857,280522,125843),
           year_2020 = c(274515,182527,386064,143015),
           year_2021 = c(365817,257637,469822,168088))

Q1 This data is in a format which limits the types of analysis that can be run and functions that can be applied. Please select the option that will transform results into a meaningful tall format with model in column 1, metric (which takes on values 'r2', 'cp', and 'rss') in column 2 and value (which contains numbers representing the three metrics) in column 3. The final dataset should have 30 rows and 3 columns.

```{r}
model = paste('model',1:10,sep = '')
r2 = c(0.849,0.782,0.853,0.853,0.856,0.855,0.859,0.856,0.859,0.859)
cp = c(3785.13,29492.891,2216.066,2515.617,1122.912,1729.176,11.453,1108.412,5.883,11.752)
rss = c(129345695398,186953511457,125825141230,126496397331,123371039554,124729600876,120875920936,123334065616,120858956753,120872109331)
results = data.frame(model, r2, cp, rss)
```

```{r}
results
```

```{r}
results %>% pivot_longer('model', 'metric', 'value')
results %>% pivot_longer(cols = cp:rss, names_to = 'metric', values_to = 'value')
results %>% pivot_longer(cols = 2:4, names_to = 'metric', values_to = 'value')
results%>%  pivot_wider(names_from = model,values_from = r2:rss)

Q2 What is the operating margin ratio (=income/sales) for Amazon in 2017?

```{r}

sales_longer = sales%>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:6, names_to = 'year', values_to = 'income')

income_longer
sales_longer

income_longer %>% 
  inner_join(sales_longer, by = c('company' = 'company', 'year' = 'year'))%>%
  filter(year == 'year_2017', company == 'Amazon')%>%
  mutate(operating_margin_ratio = (sale/income)) #Why si this s

new_table
```

```{r}
mean(new_table$operating_margin_ratio)
```

What is the average operating margin ratio (=income/sales) across the four companies in 2021?

```{r}

new_table2
```

```{r}
mean(new_table2$operating_margin_ratio)
```
