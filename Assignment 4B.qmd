## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).


Q1 One would expect those who ride a taxi for a long distance will tip more generously. To examine this hypothesis, construct a simple regression to predict tip_amount with trip_distance. Call this model1. What is the p-value for the F-statistic?

Q 2 What is the R-squared (R2) for model1? (Think about what this says about model performance).
Q5.  
Since model1 is built on sample data, it is important to see if the coefficient estimates will be non-zero in the population. Indicate whether the following statement is True or False.

```{r}
model1 = lm(tip_amount~trip_distance,data=train)
summary(model1)
```


Q3 
The first trip (i.e., first row) in the train data covered a distance of 1.26 miles. Based on model1, what is the predicted tip_amount for this trip?

```{r}
predict(model1, newdata = data.frame(trip_distance = 1.26))
```


Q 4: What is the RMSE (root mean squared error) for model1?


```{r}

pred = predict(model1)
rmse1 = sqrt(mean((pred - train$tip_amount)^2)); rmse1
```

Q 6

Imagine a person takes a taxi to go to work, 10 miles away. Based on model1, how much do you think they will tip?

```{r}
predict(model1, newdata = data.frame(trip_distance = 10))
```

Q 7) For every additional mile driven for a trip, how much more can a taxi driver expect to get in tips?

```{r}
predict(model1, newdata = data.frame(trip_distance = 6)) - predict(model1, newdata = data.frame(trip_distance = 5))

ggplot(data=train,aes(x=period_of_day,y=tip_amount,fill=period_of_day))+
  geom_bar(stat='summary',fun='mean',position='dodge')+
  guides(fill=F)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_dollar())+
  theme_bw()

```




q8 Let us see if passengers tip more generously at certain times of the day. Construct a model to predict tip_amount based on period_of_day. Call this model2. Based on model2, which of the following are true. Select one or more correct answers.

```{r}

model2 = lm(tip_amount~period_of_day,data=train)
summary(model2)
```
Q9 It is conceivable that the trips vary by day of the week. To investigate this, construct a model to predict tip_amount based on pickup_day. Call this model3. Based on model3, which of the following are true. Select one or more correct answers.


```{r}
model3 = lm(tip_amount~pickup_day,data=train)
summary(model3)
```
Q10. Let us see if tipping varies by number of passengers. To investigate this, construct a model to predict tip_amount based on passenger_count. Call this model4. Based on model4, on average how much more can a taxi driver expect to get in tips for every additional passenger?

```{r}
model4 = lm(tip_amount~passenger_count,data=train)
summary(model4)
```
Q11

Which of the following models has the lowest RMSE? A lower RMSE reflects better predictions. #model 4, model 3 or model 2

```{r}
pred = predict(model4)
rmse4 = sqrt(mean((pred - train$tip_amount)^2)); rmse4
```

```{r}
pred = predict(model3)
rmse3 = sqrt(mean((pred - train$tip_amount)^2)); rmse3
```

```{r}
pred = predict(model2)
rmse2 = sqrt(mean((pred - train$tip_amount)^2)); rmse2
```
